    "1. **`players.csv`** – Contains information about the players, including their experience level, subscription status, and hours played.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `players.csv` dataset provides detailed information about the players, which includes their **experience level**, **subscription status**, **gameplay hours**, and basic demographic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main columns in `players.csv`:\n",
    "- **`experience`**: The experience level of the player (e.g., \"Pro\", \"Veteran\", \"Regular\", \"Amateur\").\n",
    "- **`subscribe`**: A boolean value indicating whether the player has a subscription (`True` or `False`).\n",
    "- **`hashedEmail`**: A unique identifier for the player, stored as a hashed email address.\n",
    "- **`played_hours`**: The total number of hours the player has spent playing the game.\n",
    "- **`name`**: The player's name.\n",
    "- **`gender`**: The player's gender.\n",
    "- **`age`**: The player's age.\n",
    "- **`individualId`**: An identifier for the player, possibly an internal ID for tracking purposes.\n",
    "- **`organizationName`**: The name of the player's organization (if applicable).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Information from `players.csv`:\n",
    "- **Number of Rows**: 196 players.\n",
    "- **Number of Columns**: 9 attributes per player.\n",
    "- **Data Types**: The dataset contains both categorical (e.g., `experience`, `gender`) and numerical (e.g., `played_hours`, `age`) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is important for understanding **player behavior** and how factors like **experience** and **age** might influence the number of connections (active players) at different times of the day.\n",

    "#### Main columns in `sessions.csv`:\n",
    "- **`hashedEmail`**: The player's unique identifier (same as in `players.csv`).\n",
    "- **`start_time`**: The start time of the player's session, recorded as a string in the format `DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM`.\n",
    "- **`end_time`**: The end time of the player's session, also recorded as a string in the same format as `start_time`.\n",
    "- **`original_start_time`**: A timestamp in Unix format, representing the session's start time.\n",
    "- **`original_end_time`**: A timestamp in Unix format, representing the session's end time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Information from `sessions.csv`:\n",
    "- **Number of Rows**: 1535 session entries.\n",
    "- **Number of Columns**: 5 attributes per session.\n",

    "This dataset is critical for determining **when players are active**, and analyzing **peak hours** or **days of the week** for player activity.

    "### **Data Cleaning and Wrangling**\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets were cleaned and preprocessed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Datetime Conversion**: The `start_time` and `end_time` columns in the `sessions.csv` dataset were converted to proper `datetime` format to allow time-based analysis.\n",
    "- **Session Duration**: We calculated the **session duration** by subtracting the `start_time` from the `end_time` to get the total duration of each session in minutes.\n",
    "- **Handling Missing Data**: Rows with missing `end_time` values were dropped, as the session duration could not be calculated without this information.\n",
    "- **Feature Extraction**: We extracted the **hour** and **day of the week** from the `start_time` column to enable analysis of player activity patterns by time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then aggregated the data by **hour**, **day of the week**, and both **hour and day of the week** to identify trends in player activity, which is essential for understanding when to allocate server resources more efficiently.\n"
